The lab is focused on human evolution, especially in the ways in which gene regulatory processes have contributed to it. Because gene regulation is not easily predicted (at least for now!) from sequence-level data, we use induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) as models to understand the means by which multiple cellular mechanisms interact to regulate gene expression, and, under the action of natural selection, ultimately give rise to inter-species or population-level differences. We are one of few labs worldwide with an established record in generating iPSC lines from non-model organisms, and we combine this expertise with our experience working with the latest genomic technologies.

At the University of Melbourne we enjoy very close links with the School of BioSciences and of Mathematics and Statistics, as well as the Centre for Stem Cell Systems, and we are affiliate members of Stem Cells Australia, a multi-institution, multi-disciplinary initiative that brings together Australia’s leading stem cell research groups across different expertises and interests. Further afield, we also have links to researchers at institutions like MCRI, A*STAR, Massey University, Nanyang Technological University, Monash Malaysia, the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Penn State University, the Centro de Regulación Genómica in Barcelona and more.

Our lab is committed to carrying out high quality reproducible research, be that computational or molecular biology based. To that end we make source code and all data and protocols available on publication
