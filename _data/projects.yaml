  description: The Denisovans were archaic hominins who made substantial contributions to the genomes of the present-day peoples of Papua New Guinea and, more broadly, Southeast Asians, but the biological consequences of this are poorly understood.  We combine multiple computational and experimental approaches (functional genomics, machine learning, MPRAs) to understand what their DNA means today to the people who carry it.

  description: We , which test the regulatory potential of thousands of genetic variants at once, have great potential as tools in evolutionary biology. We are fans of them at both the computational and experimental level.
