  description: The Denisovans were archaic hominins who made substantial contributions to the genomes of the present-day peoples of Papua New Guinea and, more broadly, Southeast Asians, but the biological consequences of this are poorly understood.  We combine multiple computational and experimental approaches (functional genomics, machine learning, MPRAs) to understand what their DNA means today to the people who carry it.

  description: We have been working with researchers in Indonesia to quantifying functional genetic diversity across the Indonesian archipelago (the world's fourth largest country by population!) at the bulk and single-cell levels. We want to understand the interplay of genetic and environmental forces in shaping gene expression and, more broadly, human phenotypes, in this part of the world, and how these compare to other populations worldwide.

  description: Multiplexed assays of variant effects (MAVEs) are a set of methods that allow the experimental dissection of many genetic variants simultaneously. We are particularly interested in exploring the potential of massively parallel reporter assays, which test the regulatory potential of thousands of genetic variants at once, as tools in evolutionary biology.

  description: The lack of diversity in human genetics datasets has been well-documented, especially at the DNA level. We are interested in looking beyond that, and quantifying both the downstream consequences of existing biases in the field, as well as diversity in other modalities of data, with a current focus on transcriptomics.
